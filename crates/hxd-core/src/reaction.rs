//! Reactions (`docs/hotline-ng.md` §7.3): an emoji an account attaches to
//! a public line, counted on the line and kept beside it in the log.
//!
//! A reaction is an **account's**, by the mailbox rule, never a session's
//! or a nick's: every session of an account shares one set, and a
//! reaction survives a nick change, a reconnect and a link of the
//! account's identity. So only an account that is one person reacts —
//! never a guest, whose login everybody shares.
